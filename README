Games::Quakeworld::Query 0.33

Hello, and welcome to a work in progress module
called Games::Quakeworld::Query. This module
allows you to query easily Quakeworld servers,
and get their informations, i.e. map, deathmatch mode,
hostname and player ammount.

Since Perl offers you a great convenience called perlpod,
to see a better documentation of this module, just
type perldoc Games::Quakeworld::Query, and you'll se the doc.

I'm a lousy writer so I stop it here and recommend you to
consult the perlpod docs :-)
